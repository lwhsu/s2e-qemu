/// Replacement for the Linux UAPI <linux/ioctl.h> on BSD hosts.
///
/// The KVM ioctl numbers never reach the host kernel: libs2e emulates /dev/kvm entirely in
/// user space. They only need to be identical on both sides of the interface (the KVM client,
/// i.e. QEMU, and libs2e), so the native BSD encoding from <sys/ioccom.h> is used. This avoids
/// clashing with the _IO* macros that the system <sys/ioctl.h> defines. Note that the BSD size
/// field is 13 bits wide (up to 8191 bytes); the largest KVM ioctl payload, struct kvm_xsave,
/// is 4096 bytes.
